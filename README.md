## My repository for my website GrooveGallery

GrooveGallery is an online platform that lets users blend and pair their favorite music with visual art or photography. This creates a unique space for artistic expression and lets users share or contribute a diverse array of image-song combinations. The fusion of art and music will open up for creative storytelling and personal expression, making GrooveGallery an excellent destination for photography and music.
